Your task in this activity is to add a marker to the map.

You can add your code to the createMapMarker() function in the mapmarker.js file. The marker should be set at the location defined by the following coordinates:

Longitude: -71.091542
Latitude: 42.358862
To accomplish this task, you will need to do the following:

Create a mapbox account and get the access token.
Add the access token to the mapboxgl instance defined in the mapmarker.js.
Create a marker then add it to the map using mapboxgl pre-built functions.
If your code works, you should be able to see a marker on the map.
